Hello and welcome to my game. Speed Thrust is a 2D car game with 3 different levels and two cars for multiplayer competetive. 

# CODE
At first i tried to make a 3D game but i failed because it was too much for me and i failed, Then i made a fresh start with 2D. I hade no idea about different ways of moving objects in games but by watching tons of tutorials i found out
that Addforce is the best match for my game, because it gives more natrual feeling than just instant move and instant stop. I used lerp to make improvement for steering system, more speed more steering, less speed less steering like a real car.
 For lap system and in order to not cheat i used boolean onTrigger checkpoints, when they are true and player triggers the final checkpoint the lap increases. Pause, Rseume, buttons functions and other codes are very simple.
 I used old input manager instead of new input system, there are not much keys and i used only 4 keys for each player, easier with old one. I thought to use Scrpitable game objects but i saw them unnecessary for this small & solo project.

# Assets, UI
I worked alone and no disigner.
I downloaded a music and png files from internet for cars, backgrounds and buttons.    



The game is able to make a build so it is tested and playabe for Pc users.
