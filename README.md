Hello and welcome to my game. Speed Thrust is a 2D car game with three different levels and two cars for multiplayer competition.

# CODE
At first, I tried to make a 3D game, but I failed because it was too much for me. Then I made a fresh start with 2D. I had no idea about different ways of moving objects in games, but after watching tons of tutorials, I found out that Addforce is the best match for my game because it gives a more natural feeling than just an instant move and an instant stop. I used lerp to make improvements to the steering system—more speed, more steering, less speed, less steering—like a real car. Physic material is used in order to give a small friction and bounciness.
For the lap system and in order to not cheat, I used boolean onTrigger checkpoints; when they are true and the player triggers the final checkpoint, the lap increases. Pause, resume, button functions, and other codes are very simple.
I used the old input manager instead of the new input system; there are not many keys, and I used only 4 keys for each player, which was easier with the old one. I thought to use Scrpitable game objects, but I saw them as unnecessary for this small and solo project.

# Assets, UI
I worked alone and without a designer.
I downloaded music and png files from the internet for cars, backgrounds, and buttons.
I made the roads by using a complex tool, which I downloaded from Sebastian Lague, the YouTuber.


# Other
I used YouTube tutorials like Brackeys and Jason Weimann to get inspired and know what to do; no copy-paste.
I could add more features if I had more time, not only to work but to research and learn too. I learned a lot.
The game is able to make a build, so it is tested and playable for PC users.
Unity version used 2023.3.10f
