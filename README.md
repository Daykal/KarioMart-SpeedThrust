Hello and welcome to my game. Speed Thrust is a 2D car game with 3 different levels and two cars for multiplayer competetive. 

# CODE
At first i tried to make a 3D game but i failed because it was too much for me, Then i made a fresh start with 2D. I hade no idea about different ways of moving objects in games but by watching tons of tutorials i found out that Addforce is the best match for my game, because it gives more natrual feeling than just instant move and instant stop. I used lerp to make improvement for steering system, more speed more steering, less speed less steering like a real car. Physic material is used in order to give a small friction and bouncines.
 For lap system and in order to not cheat i used boolean onTrigger checkpoints, when they are true and player triggers the final checkpoint the lap increases. Pause, Resume, buttons functions and other codes are very simple.
 I used old input manager instead of new input system, there are not much keys and i used only 4 keys for each player, easier with old one. I thought to use Scrpitable game objects but i saw them unnecessary for this small & solo project.

# Assets, UI
I worked alone and no disigner.
I downloaded a music and png files from internet for cars, backgrounds and buttons.    


# Other
I used youtubers turorial like Brackeys and Jason Weimann to get inspired and know what to do, no copy paste.
I could add more features if i had more time, not only to work but to research and learn too. I learned alot.
The game is able to make a build so it is tested and playabe for Pc users.
